/**
 @abstract Fetches collection of comments for particular post/content.
 
 @discussion:
 You can also fetch comment thread. i.e all the comments under particular comment.
 To do that set `filterByParentId` to true and pass the parent comment id in
 `parentId`. If `filterByParentId` is true but no `parentId` is present,then the
 collection will return all comments without a parent.
 
 @remarks:
 When `orderBy` is set to:
 
 - `.ascending`, we will fetch the first (oldest) comments
 in chronological order: ABC first, then the next page etc.
 
 - `.descending`, we will fetch the last (newest) comments
 in reverse-chronological order: ZYX first, then the previous page etc.
 
 It's up to the developer to call the right `loadNext`/`loadPrevious` page in
 the returned collection based on the `orderBy` value:
 
 @note when asking for more comments, based on the orderBy preference,
 you'll need to ask for the next page (if the order is `.ascending`) or the
 previous page (if the reverse is `.descending`).
 
 @param referenceId: The id of the post/content that you want to fetch comment for.
 @param referenceType: The reference type for this comment. Use .content as reference type if you are querying comments for external content else use .post.
 @param filterByParentId: Set this to true if you want to fetch comment thread
 @param parentId: The id of the parent comment.
 @param queryOption: Enum to fetch only deleted comments, not deleted comments or both.
 @param orderBy: Whether we'd like the collection in chronological order or not.
 @param includeDeleted: Boolean whether this collection should fetch comments along with deleted comments
 @return The messages collection.
